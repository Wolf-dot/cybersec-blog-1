<p>
We'll create three containers, an Attacker, a Reverse-Proxy, and a Victim. 👹🤖🤔 </br>
We'll configure the reverse-proxy to serve a harmless website and proxy requests to our hidden attacker server. 😇😈 </br>
We'll use a RAT, remote access tool, to control the victim. 🐀💀 </br>
We'll capture packets and analyze them. 🔍🤔
